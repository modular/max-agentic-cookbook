    "description": "This recipe walks through an end-to-end image captioning workflow that lets you upload pictures, tweak the guiding prompt, and generate natural-language captions through the OpenAI-compatible Vercel AI SDK transport capable of integrating with Modular MAX. The client component manages uploads, gallery state, and Mantine-based UI controls, then forwards the prompt and base64-encoded image to a Next.js API route. That route proxies the request to whichever OpenAI-compatible endpoint you select, using the SDK's chat abstraction to produce a caption and return it to the browser."
