# Use AnythingLLM and DeepSeek R1 with MAX Serve

Building on the solid foundation MAX provides, adding a robust user interface is a natural next step.

In this recipe you will:

- Use MAX Serve to provide an OpenAI-compatible endpoint for [DeepSeek R1](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120)
- Set up [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) to provide a robust chat interface
- Learn how to orchestrate multiple services in pure Python, without tools like Kubernetes or docker-compose

## About AnythingLLM

AnythingLLM is a powerful platform offering a familiar chat interface for interacting with open-source AI models. Like MAX, AnythingLLM empowers users to maintain complete ownership of their AI infrastructure, avoiding vendor lock-in risks, and enhancing privacy. With [over 30,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm), AnythingLLM has become one of the most popular solutions for private AI deployment. The platform's versatility allows it to work perfectly with MAX to create a complete end-to-end AI solution.

## Requirements

Please make sure your system meets our [minimum requirements](https://docs.modular.com/max/get-started).

### Magic ðŸª„

To proceed, ensure you have the `magic` CLI installed:

```bash
curl -ssL https://magic.modular.com/ | bash
```

...or update `magic` to the latest version:

```bash
magic self-update
```

### Hugging Face

A valid [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) ensures access to the model and weights.

### Docker

We'll use Docker to run the AnythingLLM container. Follow the instructions in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) if you need to install it.

## Get the code

Download the code for this recipe using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modular/max-recipes.git
cd max-recipes/max-serve-anythingllm
```

Next, include your Hugging Face token in a `.env` file by running:

```bash
echo "HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here" >> .env
```

## Quick start: Run the app

You can start MAX and AnythingLLM with one command:

```bash
magic run app
```

This command is defined in the `pyproject.toml` file which we will cover later.

MAX Serve is ready once you see a line containing the following in the log output:

```plaintext
max.serve: Server ready on http://0.0.0.0:3002/
```

AnythingLLM is ready once you see a line like the following in the log output:

```plaintext
Primary server in HTTP mode listening on port 3001
```

Note: the port that AnythingLLM reports can differ from the port you configure in `pyroject.toml` as the `UI_PORT`.

Once both servers are ready, launch AnythingLLM in your browser at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Using AnythingLLM

When you run the command `magic run app`, the Python script `main.py` will orchestrate getting both MAX and AnythingLLM up and running. Notably, it will create a `data` folder if one doesn't exist. AnythingLLM uses this folder as persistent storage for your settings, chat history, etc. The location of the folder is configurable within `pyproject.toml` by changing the value of `UI_STORAGE_LOCATION`.

The first time you [launch AnythingLLM in your browser](http://localhost:3001), you will see a welcome screen. Choose *Get Started*, then complete the following steps:

1. Select *Generic OpenAI* as the LLM provider, then enter:
    - Base URL = `http://host.docker.internal:3002/v1`
    - API Key = `local` (MAX doesn't require an API key, but this field can't be blank)
    - Chat Model Name = `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B`
    - Token Context Window = `16384` (Must match `MAX_CONTEXT_LENTH` from `pyproject.toml`)
    - Max Tokens = `1024`
2. Next, for User Setup, choose *Just me* or *My team*, and set an admin password.
3. If asked to fill in a survey, you may participate or skip this step. (The survey data goes to the AnythingLLM project, not Modular.)
4. Finally, enter a workspace name.

## Understand the project

Let's explore how the key components of this recipe work together.

### Configuration with `pyproject.toml`

The recipe is configured in the `pyproject.toml` file, which defines:

1. **Environment variables** to control the ports, storage locations, and additional settings:
   - `MAX_SECRETS_LOCATION = ".env"`: Location of file containing your Hugging Face token
   - `MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH = "16384"`: LLM context window size
   - `MAX_BATCH_SIZE = "1"`: LLM batch size (use 1 when running on CPU)
   - `MAX_SERVE_PORT = "3002"`: Port for MAX Serve
   - `UI_PORT = "3001"`: Port for AnythingLLM
   - `UI_STORAGE_LOCATION = "./data"`: Persistent storage for AnythingLLM
   - `UI_CONTAINER_NAME = "anythingllm-max"`: Name for referencing the container with Docker

2. **Tasks** you can run with the `magic run` command:
   - `app`: Runs the main Python script that coordinates both services
   - `setup`: Sets up persistent storage for AnythingLLM
   - `ui`: Launches the AnythingLLM Docker container
   - `llm`: Starts MAX Serve with DeepSeek R1
   - `clean`: Cleans up network resources for both services

3. **Dependencies** for running both services:
   - MAX Serve runs via the `max-pipelines` CLI
   - AnythingLLM runs in a Docker container, keeping its dependencies isolated
   - Additional dependencies to orchestrate both services

### Setup with `setup.py`

The `setup.py` script handles the initial setup for AnythingLLM:

- Reads the `UI_STORAGE_LOCATION` from `pyproject.toml`
- Creates the storage directory if it doesn't exist
- Ensures an empty `.env` file is present for AnythingLLM settings
- This script is automatically run as a pre-task when you execute `magic run app`

### Orchestration with `main.py`

When you run `magic run app`, the `main.py` script coordinates everything necessary to start and shutdown both services:

1. **Command-line Interface**
   - Uses [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) to provide a simple CLI
   - Supports main tasks to run concurently, pre-tasks, and post-tasks
   - Default command from pyproject.toml runs: `python main.py llm ui --pre setup --post clean`

2. **run_app()**
   - Loads environment variables, including those from the configured secrets location
   - Uses [Honcho](https://honcho.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to run multiple `magic run` tasks concurrently
   - Starts both the MAX Serve LLM backend and AnythingLLM UI

3. **run_task()**
   - Executes individual tasks like `setup` or `clean`
   - Reads task definitions from `pyproject.toml`
   - Pre-tasks run before main tasks, post-tasks are registered with `atexit` to ensure cleanup

4. **Cleanup Process**
   - Post-tasks (like `clean`) are automatically run when the application exits
   - The `clean` task terminates all processes, releases all ports, and removes the AnythingLLM container from Docker
