*   Mochi is Chris's dog
    
*   She was adopted from South Korea
    
*   She's mostly a mutt, but all of her cousins are Japanese Spitz
    
*   The Japanese Spitz is often called "The Clown of the Dog World," and true to form Mochi like to dance on her hind legs
    
*   She tries to look tough in front of all the neighborhood dogs, but is a real softie who likes to cuddle
