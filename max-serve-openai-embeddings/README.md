# Generate Embeddings with MPNet

> Note that this recipe works on compatible Linux machines.
> We are actively working on enabling MAX Serve for MacOS ARM64 as well.

Embeddings are a crucial component of intelligent agents, enabling efficient search and retrieval of proprietary information. MAX supports creation of embeddings using an OpenAI-compatible API, including the ability to run the popular `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` model from Hugging Face. When you run MPNet on MAX, you'll be serving a high-performance implementation of the model built by Modular engineers with the MAX Graph API.

In this recipe you will:

- Run an OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint on MAX Serve with Docker
- Generate embeddings with MPNet using the OpenAI Python client

## About MPNet

MPNet works by encoding not only tokens (words and parts of words) but also positional data about where those tokens appear in a sentence. Upon its [publication in 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09297), MPNet met or exceeded the capability of popular predecessors, BERT and XLNet. Today, it is one of the most popular open-source models for generating embeddings.

## Requirements

Please make sure your system meets our [system requirements](https://docs.modular.com/max/get-started).

To proceed, ensure you have the `magic` CLI installed:

```bash
curl -ssL https://magic.modular.com/ | bash
```

or update it via:

```bash
magic self-update
```

A valid [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) is required to access the model.
Once you have obtained the token, include it in `.env` by:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

then add your token in `.env`

```bash
HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN_HERE>
```

### GPU requirements

For running the app on GPU, ensure your system meets these GPU requirements:

* Supported GPUs: NVIDIA A100 (optimized), A10G, L4, or L40.
* Docker and Docker Compose: Installed with [NVIDIA GPU support](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu).
* NVIDIA Drivers: [Installation guide here](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx).
* NVIDIA Container Toolkit: [Installation guide here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).

## Get the Code

Download the code for this recipe using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modular/max-recipes.git
cd max-recipes/max-serve-openai-embeddings
```

## Quick start: Run the embedding application

Serving MPNet on MAX is trivial with Magic and Docker. Simply run:

```bash
magic run app
```

This command is defined in the `pyproject.toml` file. It will run a script (`run.sh`) to determine if your machine has an NVIDIA GPU, and
start the MAX container with or without GPU support accordingly. The script selects between the `cpu` and `gpu` profiles found in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

MAX Serve is ready once you see a line containing the following in the Docker output:

```plaintext
Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8000/
```

When the embedding code in `main.py` runs, you should see output like this:

```plaintext
=== Generated embeddings with OpenAI client ===
Successfully generated embeddings!
Number of embeddings: 5
Embedding dimension: 768
1st few values of 1st embedding: [0.36384445428848267, -0.7647817730903625, ...]
```

When you are done with the app, to clean up and remove the docker images, run:

```bash
magic run clean
```

## Understand the code

The code for this recipe is intentionally simple â€” we're excited for you to start building *your own* project on MAX.

Open up `main.py` in your code editor. At the top of the file, you'll see the following:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

MODEL_NAME = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"  #1
BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/v1"
API_KEY="local"

client = OpenAI(base_url=BASE_URL, api_key=API_KEY)  #2

def main():
    """Test embeddings using OpenAI client"""
    sentences = [  #3
        "Rice is often served in round bowls.",
        "The juice of lemons makes fine punch.",
        "The bright sun shines on the old garden.",
        "The soft breeze came across the meadow.",
        "The small pup gnawed a hole in the sock."
    ]

    try:
        response = client.embeddings.create(  #4
            model=MODEL_NAME,
            input=sentences
        )
        print("\n=== Generated embeddings with OpenAI client ===")
        print("Successfully generated embeddings!")
        print(f"Number of embeddings: {len(response.data)}")  #5
        print(f"Embedding dimension: {len(response.data[0].embedding)}")
        print(f"First embedding, first few values: {response.data[0].embedding[:5]}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error using client: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Here's what the code does:

1. Sets constants for the model name, MAX Serve URL and API key. (Note: You can use any value for `API_KEY`; MAX Serve does not use one, but the OpenAI client requires this value not be blank.)
2. Initializes the OpenAI client.
3. Defines a list of sample sentences. (The samples here are taken from the [Harvard Sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_sentences).)
4. Uses the OpenAI client with MAX Serve to generate the embeddings.
5. Accesses the embeddings the OpenAI client returns.

Note how the code is a drop-in replacement for the proprietary OpenAI API---this is a key advantage of building with MAX!
