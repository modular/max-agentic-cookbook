## Technical deep dive

### Single agent chat implementation

#### 1. Agent configuration

```python
client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B",
    base_url=LLM_SERVER_URL,
    api_key=LLM_API_KEY,
    model_info={
        "name": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B",
        "family": "deepseek",
        "pricing": {"prompt": 0.0, "completion": 0.0},
    },
    temperature=0.7,  # Adjust for more/less creative responses
    max_tokens=4096,  # Adjust for longer conversation
)

assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    model_client=client,
    system_message="You are a helpful assistant.",
)
```

Key features:

* Uses DeepSeek-R1 model through MAX Serve
* Configurable temperature for response creativity
* Adjust `max_tokens` for longer conversations

#### 2. Conversation management

```python
# Keep track of conversation history
conversation_history = []

# Add user message to history
conversation_history.append(TextMessage(content=user_input, source="user"))

# Get AI response with full context
response = await assistant.on_messages(
    conversation_history,  # Pass entire history
    CancellationToken(),
)
conversation_history.append(response.chat_message)
```

Benefits:

* Maintains context across multiple turns
* Enables coherent multi-turn conversations
* Preserves conversation state

#### 3. Thinking process visibility

The agent separates its thinking from its final response:

```python
content = response.chat_message.content
parts = content.split('</think>')
if len(parts) > 1:
    thinking = parts[0].strip()
    final_answer = parts[1].strip()
else:
    thinking = "No explicit thinking process shown"
    final_answer = content.strip()
```

This allows users to see:

* The reasoning process
* Considered alternatives
* Decision-making steps

#### 4. Rich terminal interface

The chat interface uses Rich for enhanced visualization:

```python
console.print(Panel(
    Markdown(thinking),
    border_style="yellow",
    title="[bold]💭 Thinking Process[/bold]",
    title_align="left"
))

console.print(Panel(
    Markdown(final_answer),
    border_style="green",
    title="[bold]🤖 Response[/bold]",
    title_align="left"
))
```

Features:

* Color-coded panels for different content types
* Markdown rendering for formatted text
* Clear separation of thinking and responses
* Status indicators during processing

### Multi-agent screenplay development

The screenplay development system uses multiple specialized agents working together through round-robin conversation. Here's a detailed look at the implementation:

#### 1. Specialized agent definitions

```python
screenwriter = AssistantAgent(
    name="screenwriter",
    system_message="""You are an experienced screenwriter who creates engaging movie scenes and dialogue.
First think about the scene carefully. Consider:
- Setting and atmosphere
- Character development
- Plot progression
Then write a brief but vivid scene with clear stage directions and dialogue.""",
    model_client=client,
)

story_critic = AssistantAgent(
    name="story_critic",
    system_message="""You are a story development expert. Review the screenwriter's scene and think about:
- Plot coherence and dramatic tension
- Character motivations and arcs
- Theme development
Then provide:
1. An improved version of the scene
2. A list of specific improvements made and why they work better""",
    model_client=client,
)

dialogue_expert = AssistantAgent(
    name="dialogue_expert",
    system_message="""You are a dialogue specialist. Review both the original and improved scenes, then think about:
- Character voice authenticity
- Subtext and emotional depth
- Natural flow and rhythm
Then provide:
1. A final version with enhanced dialogue
2. A list of specific dialogue improvements made and their impact on the scene""",
    model_client=client,
)
```

Each agent has a specific role:

* **Screenwriter**: Creates initial scene drafts
* **Story Critic**: Improves plot and structure
* **Dialogue Expert**: Enhances character voices and interactions

#### 2. Team coordination

```python
agent_team = RoundRobinGroupChat(
    agents=[screenwriter, story_critic, dialogue_expert],
    max_turns=3,  # One turn for each agent
    speaker_selection_method="round_robin"
)
```

The round-robin chat ensures:

* Ordered turn-taking between agents
* Complete review cycle for each scene
* Collaborative improvement process

#### 3. Message processing and display

```python
async for message in stream:
    if hasattr(message, 'content') and hasattr(message, 'source'):
        content = message.content
        source = message.source

        # Split thinking and contribution
        parts = content.split('</think>')
        if len(parts) > 1:
            thinking = parts[0].strip()
            final_answer = parts[1].strip()
        else:
            thinking = "No explicit thinking process shown"
            final_answer = content.strip()

        # Display each agent's contribution
        console.print(Panel(
            Markdown(thinking),
            border_style="yellow",
            title=f"[bold]💭 {source} Thinking[/bold]",
            title_align="left"
        ))

        console.print(Panel(
            Markdown(final_answer),
            border_style="green",
            title=f"[bold]🎬 {source} Contribution[/bold]",
            title_align="left"
        ))
```

Features:

* Real-time display of each agent's process
* Clear attribution of contributions
* Separation of thinking and final output
* Rich formatting for readability

#### Example workflow

1. **Initial Scene Creation**

```
User: Write a scene about a reunion between old friends
